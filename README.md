## Introduction

Hosting: https://julian-ramirez1158.github.io/

This project serves as a basic search engine web app. The main page consists of a title banner as well as a text input field with which the user can search for GIF images of their choosing. The search function is executed with a button adjacent to the search input field. Once the user inputs a key word and executes the search, a series of GIF images are displayed on the page. The technologies used in this project are HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery. The web app also makes use of the GIPHY API in order to return data to the page in the form of GIF images. The site can improve by integrating more sophisticated Javascript logic, adding one or two more HTML pages offering different content, and elevating the general styling of the page.
